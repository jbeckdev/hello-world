# hello-world
My first official repo used for learning Github and git.

I've been studying programming on my own for about a year now. I have a good grasp of the basics of web dev, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also know how to work with some backend tech like Node.js and Express, as well as MongoDB. Currently, I'm working on projects to put my knowledge to use, and show potential employers what I'm capable of building. 

This is my introduction to Github and git, and it is long overdue! Thanks for reading.
